    <rdfs:label>State Conservation Rank</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>A rank assigned by New York Natural Heritage to each species and community type indicating how imperiled it is in New York State. The state conservation rank is based on how rare or abundant the species or community type is in New York, its distribution, and on population trends and threats. As new information becomes available, ranks may be revised. The ranks are based on a one to five scale, ranging from S1 = critically imperiled to S5 = demonstrably secure (common and widespread). Natural Heritage conservation status ranks carry no legal or regulatory weight. Basic state conservation ranks are: S1 – Critically Imperiled in New York State S2 – Imperiled in New York State S3 – Vulnerable in New York State S4 – Apparently Secure in New York State S5 – Definitely Secure in New York State (common and widespread) SH – Historical in New York: not seen since before 1980, but could still be present SX—Extirpated: no longer present in New York SU – Unrankable: Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends. SNR – Not Ranked: state conservation status not yet assessed. SNA – Not Applicable, because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities (e.g., species is a hybrid, a domesticated species, not native to New York, an accidental or infrequent visitor outside of its normal range, a transient migrant just passing through the state, or a species with only unconfirmed or doubtful reports). Variations of these ranks include: • Range ranks, such as S1S2, indicate not enough information is available to distinguish between two single ranks. • ? after a rank, such as S2?, indicates some uncertainty about the true rank, but is most likely the assigned rank. • B after a rank, such as S2B, indicates the rank applies to the breeding populations in New York of a migratory animal. • N after a rank, such as S3N, indicates the rank applies to the non-breeding populations in New York of a migratory animal.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:label>Global Conservation Rank</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>A rank assigned by New York Natural Heritage to each species and community type indicating how imperiled the species or community type is throughout the world. The global conservation rank is based on how rare the species or community type is across its global range, and on population trends and threats. For species, these ranks provide an estimate of extinction risk; while for natural communities, they provide an estimate of the risk of elimination. As new information becomes available, ranks may be revised. The ranks are based on a one to five scale, ranging from G1 = critically imperiled to G5 = demonstrably secure (common and widespread). Natural Heritage conservation status ranks carry no legal or regulatory weight. Basic global conservation ranks are: G1 – Critically Imperiled (very high risk of extinction) G2 – Imperiled (high risk of extinction) G3 – Vulnerable (moderate risk of extinction) G4 – Apparently Secure (uncommon but not rare) G5 – Definitely Secure (common and widespread) GH – Possibly Extinct: not seen anywhere in last 30, but could still exist GX – Extinct: no longer present anywhere in the world GU – Unrankable: Currently unrankable due to lack of information or due to substantially conflicting information about status or trends. GNR – Not Ranked: global conservation status not yet assessed. GNA – Not Applicable, because the species is not a suitable target for conservation activities (e.g., species is a hybrid, or a domesticated species). Variations of these ranks include: • Range ranks, such as G1G2, indicate not enough information is available to distinguish between two single ranks. • ? after a rank, such as G2?, indicates some uncertainty about the true rank, but is most likely the assigned rank. • T ranks, such as T3, indicate the rank applies to a subspecies or variety, but not to the species as a whole.</rdfs:comment>

Subgroups are not always equivalent to a single taxonomic group, and they are given English names. For natural communities, subgroup is the subsystem to which the natural community belongs. Marine and tidal wetland systems are divided into subtidal and intertidal subsystems. The freshwater nontidal wetlands system is divided into open mineral soil wetlands, forested mineral soil wetlands, open peatlands, and forested peatlands. The uplands system is divided into open uplands, barrens and woodlands, and forested uplands. The rivers and streams, lakes and ponds, and subterranean systems each have one subsystem.</rdfs:comment>
